Moving to emacs 24 is an opportunity to clear out my .emacs.d files that
have been evolving over ten years.

Loads of stuff just I just don't use anymore (c++, ldif...). Some
things are now in emacs itself or can be pulled in using the new package.el
package management. Much of the code is commented out anyway.

So this is my new emacs configuration based partly on starting from
scratch with package.el / emacs starter kit and partly on merging in
the remnants I still use from my my old configuration.
